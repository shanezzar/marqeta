# Marqeta

This is the **unofficial** marqeta iOS SDK generated using their official documentation,
https://www.marqeta.com/docs/core-api/sdks-landing **(openapi: 3.0.3)**


Fixed the issues according to the latest alamofire and added a library AnyCodable to make this work as expected.

P.S. I have no rights over it, I am just contributing as an open source to make their iOS SDK work.
